description: 'Wearily wandering this wondrous world. Vigorously vigilant since you were a girl. Tirelessly tending the wants and the needs. Forever foraging for flowers through weeds.   Fearlessly focussing on the path that’s upfront. Stepping serenely without so much as a brunt. Naturally unnoticing the incline’s slowly rising. Emotionally erratic as the trail’s quickly widening.   Which way must we walk when borders diverge? Relentlessly remonstrating love’s lasting urge. To tentatively admit to that which terrifies. Furiously fighting to not fall from flight.   Wounded wings wave away warped winds. Bloodlessly beating to escape what’s within. But peripheral phenomena protrude your blinds, And awareness is awakening to what lives inside.   When winds wreak havoc from every direction. Let love lay under scrutiny for further inspection. Test theories on which you’ve made your selection. And never negotiate, under a threat of rejection.'

_Wearily wandering this wondrous world.  
Vigorously vigilant since you were a girl.  
Tirelessly tending the wants and the needs.  
Forever foraging for flowers through weeds.  
  
Fearlessly focussing on the path that's upfront.  
Stepping serenely without so much as a brunt.  
Naturally unnoticing the incline's slowly rising.  
Emotionally erratic as the trail's quickly widening.  
  
Which way must we walk when borders diverge?  
Relentlessly remonstrating love's lasting urge.  
To tentatively admit to that which terrifies.  
Furiously fighting to not fall from flight.  
  
Wounded wings wave away warped winds.  
Bloodlessly beating to escape what's within.  
But peripheral phenomena protrude your blinds,  
And awareness is awakening to what lives inside.  
  
When winds wreak havoc from every direction.  
Let love lay under scrutiny for further inspection.  
Test theories on which you've made your selection.  
And never negotiate, under a threat of rejection._
