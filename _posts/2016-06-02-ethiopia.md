And I ruined it all for you, For you fell in love that night, After my steep descent through, Love’s garden we took flight.   My dreams became reality, As you kissed my trembling lips, If there has ever been causality, Then this would’ve been my wish.   You entered my heart to stay, And I gave you all the room I had, For that night and all future days, Even though it all seemed mad.   It’s just that when you finally find, Someone who fits yourself so grand, It doesn’t matter if love seems blind, Or life strives to see it banned.   My love, if I have to wait forever, Even if it turns out to be never, Then this is what I will do.   For in a simulated Ethiopia, I finally found my utopia. And that day, just like today, I love you.'

_A cozy corner seating,  
And African entourage galore,  
Sour dürüm turned out sweeter,  
Than it ever had before.  
  
And I ruined it all for you,  
For you fell in love that night,  
After my steep descent through,  
Love's garden we took flight.  
  
My dreams became reality,  
As you kissed my trembling lips,  
If there has ever been causality,  
Then this would've been my wish.  
  
You entered my heart to stay,  
And I gave you all the room I had,  
For that night and all future days,  
Even though it all seemed mad.  
  
It's just that when you finally find,  
Someone who fits yourself so grand,  
It doesn't matter if love seems blind,  
Or life strives to see it banned.  
  
My love, if I have to wait forever,  
Even if it turns out to be never,  
Then this is what I will do.  
  
For in a simulated Ethiopia,  
I finally found my utopia.  
And that day, just like today,  
I love you._
