_eons pass as light travels,  
from nuclear furnaces to your face  
as they reflect they reveal you,  
compel and appeal you  
unveil your beauty and timeless grace  
  
some light reaches me directly,  
gives me the you in the now  
some is set to travel endlessly,  
for future's prosperity  
as far as this universe's dimensions will allow  
  
I wish there to be a mirror,  
at every point in space  
so at any time,  
I can soak up your shine  
of past reflections long erased_
