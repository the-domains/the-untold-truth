description: 'Imagine a map drawn, Of everywhere we wined and dined, All the moments we stopped time, Turning evenings into dawns.   Never the opposite, always side by side, Yet constantly staring into each other’s eyes, We failed to mask our love, or wear a disguise, As even bland dishes turned into delights.   Creeping closer through this warmth we share, Like ignited embers we burned from within, Radiating heat and power though our skin, Still as we touched, we were caught unaware.   Electricity coursed through my veins, I never want this feeling to end, Even if I’m left utterly spent, For during of all those dishes, You were my champaign.'

_Imagine a map drawn,  
Of everywhere we wined and dined,  
All the moments we stopped time,  
Turning evenings into dawns.  
  
Never the opposite, always side by side,  
Yet constantly staring into each other's eyes,  
We failed to mask our love, or wear a disguise,  
As even bland dishes turned into delights.  
  
Creeping closer through this warmth we share,  
Like ignited embers we burned from within,  
Radiating heat and power though our skin,  
Still as we touched, we were caught unaware.  
  
Electricity coursed through my veins,  
I never want this feeling to end,  
Even if I'm left utterly spent,  
For during of all those dishes,  
You were my champaign._
