description: 'I left the arena, the battle won, yet feeling lost. I obtained victory, yet at which cost? Is it worth it, if the other side is yours? When virtue is left, lying on the floor?   To play the game, without knowing the rules. The bluffing causes strain throughout the duel. Stronger contestants than myself I defeat. While it’s my soul that ends up being beat.   Longing for sharing, I looked for your eyes. Our side’s celebrating makes me cringe inside. And I learn the hard way, as your gaze passes through. That no battle’s worth winning, if the only victor is you.'

_I left the arena, the battle won, yet feeling lost.  
I obtained victory, yet at which cost?  
Is it worth it, if the other side is yours?  
When virtue is left, lying on the floor?  
  
To play the game, without knowing the rules.  
The bluffing causes strain throughout the duel.  
Stronger contestants than myself I defeat.  
While it's my soul that ends up being beat.  
  
Longing for sharing, I looked for your eyes.  
Our side's celebrating makes me cringe inside.  
And I learn the hard way,  
as your gaze passes through.  
That no battle's worth winning,  
if the only victor is you._
