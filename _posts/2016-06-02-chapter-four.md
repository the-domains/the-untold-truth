_our story's half written, unfinished in time  
sentences without an end or a beginning  
as words encase emotions left undefined  
our first chapter was when I fell for you  
when your eyes bore into my heart,  
I felt I became part, of something new  
yet familiar right from the start  
chapter two was when you felt the same  
after many moments of reined in emotion  
the gaining devotion of our sparks  
would simply not remain tamed  
chapter three was when we were together  
for almost two months we were entwined  
allowing our lives to be mutually tethered  
and our journeys to become aligned  
but all good stories have twisting plots  
and now ours has been rocked to its core  
we live on in our hearts and in our thoughts  
as we are officially welcomed, to chapter four_
