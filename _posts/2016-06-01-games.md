_Tirelessly staring to pieces on maps.  
As our cards hold the future foretold.  
But cubes of chance change the deck,  
And new outcomes are there to behold.  
I tell myself I stood a chance at winning.  
That genius trumps experience at play.  
This proved to be folly from the beginning.  
As I'm surrounded by peers this whole day.  
I'll need months to even begin to match.  
The depth and speed at which we race.  
At every turn there's another catch.  
And I'm lost deeper inside this maze.  
The walls lift and the horizon is shown.  
So precious few of the pieces I own.  
For just a small moment I feel the sting,  
But quite quickly this feeling relents.  
I learned that even losing is a good thing.  
When in the company of friends._
