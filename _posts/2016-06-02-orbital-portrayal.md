_As your sun shines solemnly on our sacred souls,  
a planet and a moon dance in orbits out of control.  
  
Gravitational tides tear at your tremulous treasure,  
as our most principle beliefs are being measured.  
  
From shallow callousness to the rationally ridiculous,  
the dance turns dark as problems turn conspicuous.  
  
But entropy did not prevail, but instead set sail,  
to a destination unknown, where we might be condoned.  
  
And exist as the forms we choose to be, and are,  
in the plain light of day to see, without leaving scars.  
  
Although this dance moved in every direction,  
I believe it to be,  
that the net sum of all steps taken,  
is in the direction of you and me,  
without leading to the destruction of any of us three.  
  
Portrayed the untold truth was made true,  
and for this, today, I love you._
