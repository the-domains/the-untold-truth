<article style=""><h1>Revolve</h1><p>A poem on how love hides within the revolutions that drive evolution.</p></article>

_you're coasting and rolling  
through highs and lows  
as existential dilemmas  
give fundamental blows  
your strong strings are  
stretched to their sinews  
and long held beliefs are  
forced to be renewed  
  
energy can not be destroyed,  
nor can it be created  
but it can be drained away,  
and it can be waisted  
on great elephants that  
stubbornly stay within view  
and monsters in the dark  
who won't be subdued  
  
but rollercoasters have  
an end and a beginning  
each revolution has  
a different way of spinning  
you back and forth,  
from one side to the next  
unexpected turns  
leave your heart perplexed  
  
how many circles  
do you need to see the truth  
that one simple element  
has the power to sooth  
it's the reason behind  
the existence of this universe  
for the word revolution itself,  
contains love in reverse_
