_**Calm**,  
Inside of me,  
Your hands absent,  
From my empty palms,  
Give me clarity,  
To seem,  
**Calm**.  
  
**Mated**,  
My soul to yours,  
Overcomes any obstacle,  
Can't be evaluated,  
Opens doors,  
To be more,  
**Mated**.  
  
**Fly**,  
In dreams,  
Soar beneath stars,  
Through the sky,  
As one team,  
Be seen,  
**Fly**.  
  
**Choice**,  
I am not,  
Not yours, not now,  
A future unvoiced,  
One we forgot,  
To plot,  
**Choice**.  
  
**Now**,  
We are in,  
The polarisation,  
Of this situation,  
Knows no kin,  
It's just,  
**Now**.  
  
**Friend**,  
This I can be,  
A harbour of safety,  
On which you depend,  
In stormy seas,  
Without end,  
**Friend**._
