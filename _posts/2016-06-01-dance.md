_as you dance in sight, I reignite  
love's frozen embers melting fast  
wings unfold, we take to flight  
our separation couldn't last  
  
swimming in seas of sensuality  
hungry kisses crave for more  
we embrace as if our mortality  
is dependent on washing ashore  
  
where the tide caresses the sand  
trembling palms inside my hand  
your tiny fingers drown in these  
eyes consume with greatest ease  
  
I inhale your soul, swallow whole  
its mine for now to keep  
true passion knows no control  
so we fall and we fall steep  
  
fire begets fire, flame feeds flame  
when we're together we are the pyre  
on which burning hearts are tamed_
