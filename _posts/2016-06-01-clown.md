_Purity confronts me,  
and asks me to undress,  
take of the masks of maturity,  
and to stop trying to impress.  
  
A child's eyes in a man's body,  
still innocent despite experience.  
smiles with serene expectancy,  
and offers us deliverance.  
  
We dance to silent salutations,  
receive a thundering applause,  
emotions turn into interpretations,  
as we learn their inner cause.  
  
All expression comes from us,  
from this inner world of ours,  
our glee, our sorrow, our lust,  
our pain, our strength, our power.  
  
To have shown what I felt within,  
I owe an unlikely person gratitude,  
It is a caricature I've never been,  
but today, a clown was the one,  
that has made me renewed._
