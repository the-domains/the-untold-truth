_waves roll in on sullen sand  
the tentatively touching tide  
sends weary waters landwards  
my heart proofs unable to hide  
  
contour captured by camera  
a dark outline against the sky  
my longing's lingering stamina  
seems to render the seas dry  
  
my peer's piercing perception  
she has got my profile pegged  
and sees how love's affliction  
now keeps my heart in check  
  
but a glimmer this was to see  
as I let the world's warmth in  
this was only but a part of me  
from your sheltered soul within_
