_corners are curves as I carve my cycle through  
miles of empty freeway give me the leeway to play  
outside the sky is as blue as my bike and the shine  
of the sun on my skin is as warm as when I'm within  
you are in refractions on my helmet's visor shadow  
cast your contour on the tank between my thighs  
grip tight and push us down to the tarmac below  
I dip us down to where death is but a hairsbreadth  
away from the now we escape to where we strip  
bare until we're as naked as my bike and as hot  
as her belly flows fluently through my fingers they  
linger and grip the handlebars tight as I upright  
your curve against my waist I taste the salt of the  
wind in my face as I race to the end of your world  
and come to within inches of your glistening face  
the moaning tires come to a screeching halt as  
we drop on top of each other's spent bodywork's  
steaming in the sun as our race is finally done_
