_When bonds of love are tethered down by ties of fear,  
enchained in links forged out of insecurities,  
love has no choice but to slowly disappear,  
for her flow is solely powered by the bonded's purity.  
  
Mutually assured despair ensues,  
as threats of breakage are thrown back and forth,  
our inner most children are left subdued,  
as we undervalue our essential worth.  
  
Three hours to nothing, is left hanging in the air,  
looming above, these bonds of love,  
it makes them wither and strains their snares.  
  
Love versus principle,fear versus trust,  
assumptions are debatable,  
as our egos confront us.  
  
And an untold truth appears,  
for your eyes to see,  
last night for the first time,  
the Dragon wasn't me._
